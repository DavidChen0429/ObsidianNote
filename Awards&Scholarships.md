## How to Apply for Grant
#### Guide to Funding Research (by ASME)
1. Determine research objectives and project scope
	-  Identify the propose of your research
	-  Identify resource gap, explain why it matters, and clarify sense of purpose and focus:
		* What potential impact could this research have, both micro (your engineering specialty) and macro (for general public)
		* What are the anticipated outcomes
		* How does this research differ from previous research 
		* How does your proposed project advance the conversation beyond what's come before
		* What is the scope of the research, how long will it take, how much will it cost, and what kinds of materials and facilities will it require
		* What exactly will you need funding to cover
		* Will you need a team of people to work on this research
		* What methods or approaches do you plan to use
		* How will you measure and report your outcomes
2. Identify potential funding sources
	- Government agencies: **Directly echo larger policy priorities**. Wise to align your research with these goals.
	- Industry and business: **Thoroughly research business objectives, stated goals, budgetary reports, past sponsorships, and relevant personnel**. Draw strong connections between your intended research and the organization's goal.
	- Academic institutions
	- Crowdfunding
	- Private foundations: **Know their areas of interest and priority**
3. Prepare and submit application
	- Start application process in advance
	- Mind the detail: eligibility, evaluation criteria, deadlines, and format and content requirements
	- Know the review process
	- **Clearly articulate the significance and potential impact of your research**: 
		1) Convey the importance to the grantor
		2) Expected outcomes of your research
		3) Frame in terms of what's come before, and how will you build upon, enhance, differ from, disagree with, or advance the conversation beyond research that is already been conducted in this area
		4) Highlight your expertise and research track record
	- Keep your language tight and engaging
	- Be detailed in your budget
	- Include all supplemental materials
	- Seek support
	- Follow up
	- ==Rejection reasons==: Lack sufficient significance; unsuitable approach or failed to propose one with appropriate specificity; Not up to the task (not capable).
#### 10 Tips for Getting Grants
1. Be novel, but not too novel: A balance between passion and being too speculative
2. Include appropriate background and preliminary data: cite all relevant work
3. Find appropriate funding mechanism, read the associated request for applications very carefully, and respond specifically to the request
4. Follow the guidelines for submission very carefully and comply
5. Concise, clear, and complete: A common temptation for inexperienced grant writers is to propose to do too much
6. Capture interest of experts and nonexperts alike: use formatting tricks
7. Timing and internal review are important
8. Become a grant reviewer early in your career: Understand the process
9. Accept rejection and deal with it appropriately
