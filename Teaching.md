The process of teaching, namely, the process of outputting information rather than inputting merely, is crucial for learning, as Richard Feynman puts it. I divided teaching into two categories: "TA", facing professional student; and "To Public", facing less technical personals.

## Principles of Teaching in Higher Education
My summary of principles and values in teaching for higher education:
* Inspiring students to think out of the box;
	* Our relationship with complexity;
	* From applications to principle
	* Understand the fundament
	* Expand use examples I encountered
	* See connections between knowledge
* Different students different styles (因材施教);
	* What does he/she want
	* What form does he/she take the best
	* Which aspects of learning can he/she compensate
* Help students understand abstract concepts;
	* Encourage students to output (Richard Feynman method) and question the authority
	* Finding connections between knowledge and real-life
	* An English Translation of ...
* From applications to principle, and vice versa;
* Facilitate inner motivation, TA is only a assistant, not a parent, while the learning is done by students;
	* Asking, asking, and asking
	* Figuring out why
	* Students help students
* In the age of AI ... 

## TA
**Goal**: ==Killam Graduate TA Award!!!== [[Awards&Scholarships]]
**Requirements:
- Broad knowledge of the field:
	- Explain info clearly and logically.
- Ability to help students actively learn new knowledge, skills, and perspectives:
	- Organize events that maximize student learning;
	- Evaluate presentations constructively;
	- Actively helps students to learn transferable skills (oral and verbal communication, problem solving, critical thinking, numeracy, teamwork, and leadership).
- Working in collegial manner with students:
	- Collaborate with other GTAs to improve the learning environment for students;
	- Active listening and actions;
	- Encourage collaboration in students through projects and presentations.
- Active efforts in improving teaching:
	- Attend [workshops, seminars](Workshops&Seminar), and apply skills;
	- Reflection and action on personal and professional development.
- Demonstrate high standards, good listening, and ethics:
	- Reliability and availability;
	- Encourage and supports diversity and equity;
	- Return assignment quickly with useful constructive feedback;
	- Involve in [community services](CommunityServices) (science fairs, open houses, undergraduate/graduate events).
