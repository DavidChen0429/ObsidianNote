# I Want to Learn
* Different focus and writing styles of different genre
* How to form the logic in academic writing 

## Course Content
#### Problem-Solving Text
Situation --> Problem (Practical or Conceptual) --> Partial Solution --> Evaluation of Partial Solution --> New Solution --> Evaluation

* Situation: Background information on a particular set of circumstances
* Problem: Criticisms of or weakness surrounding a situation, claim, or policy; reasons for challenging its accuracy, superiority, completeness, or morality
	* Make sure to answer the implicit question --- so what? 
	* Frame your reader's point of view
	* For grant application, focus on the practical application side
	* Not too vague???
* Solution: Discussion of a way or ways to alleviate the problem
* Evaluation: Assessment of the merits of the proposed solution(s)

===Goal: Answer following questions:===
* Why the problem is in fact a problem
* How the solution is indeed an appropriate solution
