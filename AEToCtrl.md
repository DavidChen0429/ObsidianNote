An English Translation of ... (Control Concepts)

## Strategy
Not going to focus on coding, since generative AI is good enough in that; Not going to focus excessively on math, since many open-courses have been focused on that. In the future of AI, understanding why we need a controller, and understand the fundamentals for design are two most important abilities for an engineer. Thus, I am going to focus on explaining why (do we need this) and how (does it work). But most important, as the name of this series imply, I want to link it to our everyday life, not just using as an example, but treating every controller as a person, placing ourselves in the situation, to **think like a controller**.
