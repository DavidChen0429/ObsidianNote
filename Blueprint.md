This is an organized and the general planning of the 4 years of PhD. PhD life spanning across conducting [[Courses]], [[Research]], [teaching](Teaching.md), [winning awards and grants](Awards&Scholarships), and [getting connected to the industry](Connections.md) This note also includes knowledge from attending [[Seminars]]

## A Message for You in the Future
Since **I am not planning to show this note to anyone apart from myself**, I want to leave a message to the future self, who reads this probably because something get stuck, and he is looking for a motivation. The purpose of this message is simple, to remind him the whole reason behind creating this:  

==*I created this because I give a shit.* I give a shit about my own reputation; I give a shit about how everyone look at me; I give a shit about winning money, scholarships, and rewards; I give a shit about making my life wonderful; I give a shit about being the most competent dude that is able to solve anything by myself or working with others; and I give a shit about myself.==

I know people who have strong publication records, have won multiple scholarships, are widely respected, and receive significant support. **I believe I can become one of them as well.** 

These, are the reasons.

The more I talked to people, the more I realize three things about success:
1. Success is determined by the way you work rather than who you are;
2. Closing myself is not going to get me anywhere;
3. Success is like being pregnant, everyone says congratulations, but nobody knows how many times you get fucked;

Thus, to become a successful PhD student, and have a great subsequent career, here are some questions you need to answer:
* What is a PhD?
* What is the fundamental difference between a PhD and others?
* What are the most important abilities for a successful PhD career?
* What are some important things to do in a PhD career, and how to do it efficiently?
* How to get resources (money, chances, reputations)?
* How to be impactful?

### How to be a Star Student
The article of [How to be a Star Student](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2017/04/05/why-you-are-not-the-star-student-and-how-to-become-one/amp/) offers insight in how to succeed. Important lesson to summarize:
- Only hard work is not going to breed success.
- Information and resources mean everything:
	- Stay tuned to newsletter
	- Networking outside the lab
	- Networking outside the field of academy as well
	- Participating in organizations
- Being able to sale your research through:
	- Engaging, visual, and interesting presentation;
	- Engaging storytelling skill;
	- Clear and attractive writing is important;
	- Engage in professional conversations as a critical and creative contributor.
- Public, public, and public!!!
	- Present your work;
	- Talk about your work;
	- Practice writing by reading non-fictional English books;
	- Practice writing by engaging in non-scholarly publications.
- Being reliable attracts chances:
	- Being prompt and helpful;
- Open yourself out there:
	- Do not be afraid to present, public, and being out there;
	- Getting involve in community volunteering work;
	- Going to conference, and talk to people;
	- Being more engaged and helpful to the community.
- **The logic is different from school as a undergrad, in which quality of your work matters the most. In PhD, you started to be rewarded for the way you work, rather than just work itself. Stop perceiving things other than academic achievement as superficial.**
### You and Your Research
This long presentation of Richard Hamming offers a glimpse into what a great mind is thinking compared to ordinary researcher, a true weapon that achieves great researchers like RH. Below are the summaries:

- 纯控制在相对传统的国家还有（Systems&Control），但是在北美已经不行了，连奖学金都申不到；整个控制在IEEE里面也都是比较小的一个分支；要结合一个应用背景来做控制（套个背景来解决问题）；
- 没有技术突破的、瓶颈期的领域容易产生内卷，因为竞争的因素已经不再是技术，而是其他东西；
- 学术界和工业界的侧重点是不一样的，学术界看的就是论文，工业界看重connection；
- 奖学金主要的作用是改善生活质量；
- 思考：什么技术能带来社会变革？改变人类的格局？改变人们不同的生活？
- 思考：什么样的技术能够带来社会价值？
- 纯从国外回来找教职不是很有优势，国内的孩子太卷了；
- 不同的未来去向，以后想在哪里，你想成为不同的人，背后努力的思路是不一样的；

* 研究都是从单体到网络/分布式；
* 研究主要分两点：
	* 方向（问题）和工具；
	* 新方向 老方法
	* 老问题 新方法
* 博士需要：
	* 不要太听话：博士不是老师说什么你做什么；
	* 脑子要灵活：天马行空，多想，多跳出自己的圈子，看看别人在做什么，然后多出点子；
	* 主动找资源：大的会议报告（IFAC, ACC, CDC, etc）关键词与现在的核心方向，领英，读论文的时候那些大组，这个领域其他的老师，都在干什么；
	* 按部就班：该干什么干什么，前两年打基础确保能毕业，等到博士后期了再决定要去工业界还是学术界；
	* 和导师沟通透明化：导师是你的主要责任人；
* （海外）博士不需要：
	* 很早就决定到底要去工业界或者学术界：只需要知道两个界存在不同要求就行；
	* 太担心毕业问题，国外很多都是老师说的算，要确保导师满意你的进度；
